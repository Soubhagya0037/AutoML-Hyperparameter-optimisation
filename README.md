## 1. Overview

In this repository, we explore various methods of hyperparameter optimization to improve the performance of machine learning models. The goal is to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize the model's accuracy or other relevant metrics. We discuss and implement the following techniques:

- **Random Search**: A baseline approach where hyperparameters are randomly sampled from predefined ranges.
  
- **Bayesian Optimization**: An iterative optimization technique that uses probabilistic models to find the optimal hyperparameters based on past evaluations.
  
- **HyperOpt**: A Python library for optimizing machine learning model parameters using Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) and other algorithms.

## 2. Techniques Used

### Random Search

Random Search is implemented to randomly sample hyperparameters from predefined distributions and evaluate their performance using cross-validation or hold-out validation.

### Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian Optimization utilizes probabilistic models (such as Gaussian Processes) to model the objective function (model performance) and iteratively select the next set of hyperparameters that are likely to improve performance.

### HyperOpt

HyperOpt employs algorithms like Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to efficiently search through the hyperparameter space by leveraging past evaluations to guide the search.
